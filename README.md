# Project_Reach
An approach to improved reachability for large screen devices

Motivation
The benefits of smart phones with large screens drive their popularity. However, these devices are difficult, if not impossible to use with one hand and pose usability issues for demographics with smaller hands. The existing solutions to this include on screen functions that the user can activate to bring the screen content closer to the thumb. These methods however introduce extra steps in the users interaction with the device and can be cumbersome. Here, we propose "Project Reach" to solve this issue.
